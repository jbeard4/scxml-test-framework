  orthogonal preemption - inner or states interrupt one-another 
    conflict between transition originating in state c, and transitions originating in e1 and f1, as transition from c interrupt the others

  In SCION <= 4:   
    transitions in e1 and f1 will win, as they are deeper in the hierarchy (even though they come later in document order

  In SCION > 4 (SCXML semantics): 
    transition originating in c will win, as orthogonal component c precedes orthogonal component d in document order (even though transitions originating in d are deeper in the state hierarchy)
